## How to play and Navigating the Project
In order to play, make sure to have all of the files in the repository downloaded first. Then, simply launch the "Seeing Things.exe" and that will launch the Unity game! The program is compatible for Mac, Windows, and Linux and all the code is already compiled. The source code is located in the "Seeing Things" folder and can be viewed using the Unity Development Environment.

**Spawn Room**
Walk over towards the mask, center it on your screen, and click. That should pick up the mask and make it disappear. In order to exit the room, press V. This will put the mask on (indicated by the green visual filter and heavy breathing noise)
**Gate 1:**
The bridge is visible when the mask is off.
**Gate 2:**
The bridges alternate in visiblity between mask on and off.
**Gate 3:**
One must interact with the button (illuminated by the red light to the right) and only then can the final gate be passed. The third gate is locked off by a metal door and can only be unlocked via the button.

## How to view in Unity
https://unity.com
In order to view my project in context of the Unity Development Environment, one must download both Unity and the UnityHub. Though the executable can be launched without either of these programs, the source code and associated project requires both programs. These programs are rather large and might be a bit performance demanding for older computers so keep this in mind before downloading. Downloading and viewing the project in Unity is important to understanding the context in which the project codebase exists in. After these two programs are downloaded, the project can be opened in the UnityHub by adding the project from disk by selecting the "Seeing Things" folder (*NOT THE "SEEING THINGS_DATA" FOLDER*).

To have full access to the Unity Hub. One needs to make a Unity account. This is a quick process and should only take a few minutes. VS Code can be used to view scripts, however VS Code Studio is the preferred code editor to view the source code.
